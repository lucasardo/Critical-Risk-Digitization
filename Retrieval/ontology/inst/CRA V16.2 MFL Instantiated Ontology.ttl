           ns1:incidentDescription "Control of a ship is lost in the vicinity of the CLB wharf due to the ship, or tug, losing power or steering, a tow line breaking, or human error. This occurs in poor conditions of wind, waves and tide. The vessel moves towards the wharf at an angle and closing speed that exceeds the design capacity of dolphins and impacts the wharf. Significant wharf damage is incurred. The shiploader that is close to the point of impact is lost due to structural failure (the shiploader collapses) as a result of the impact. The other shiploader on the wharf does not suffer any direct damage, though the conveyors that deliver ore to it are damaged. The ship in the incident is immediately able to be towed to safe ground by the ports own tugs, and is refloated on the next tide, towed to deep water where repairs to the ship are completed. Shiploader 12 is the more likely Shiploader to be impacted rather than shiploader 11. A ship would have to lose both ship engines, tugs, to impact both. A ship is more likely only hit the end of the wharf, it is not really possible to hit further up the wharf closer to shore. The port (affecting both CLA and CLB) is completely closed for 1 week following regulatory closure, investigation and establishment of safe working procedures for shipping during the salvage and repair period. The nominal production in 2023 is 110.0 Mtpa forecast to be shipped from CLB.

The vessel grounds in the dedicated dredged shipping channel serving Cape Lambert before tugs can reach it. The ship sinks and blocks the channel in a manner which does not allow any other fully loaded iron ore carrier to depart from the port (both from CLA and CLB), without deviating from the designated departure channel. The open nature of the port and the strong currents, winds and tides in the area mean that it is unlikely that any grounding will lead to release of hydrocarbons from the vessel that involves a complete shutdown of the port.

After 3 days (0.429 weeks) the Cape Lambert port operation is reopened. A safe passage around the grounded vessel is identified however this means that the larger vessels with deeper drafts have to be partly loaded and instead an operational change is made to direct smaller Cape sized vessels to CLA. The net result is that 75% of the nominal Cape Lambert shipping rate is possible due to the draft restrictions created by the blocked channel. This equates to a shortfall in shipping of 25% x 190.0Mtpa = 47.5 Mtpa. This is offset by the 9.2 Mtpa shipping rate increase at Dampier, Total loss is 47.5(loss from Cape Lambert) - 9.2(Increase from Dampier) = 38.3Mtpa.

Other perils such as fire are not likely to result in complete loss. The complete loss of one shiploader (in a worst case) can be associated with damage to the other shiploader, and this is assumed to occur in this case. This could be due to a collision between them, or damage to the tripper and shiploader due to the lateral movement of conveyor belt being pulled off its normal path as the collapsed shiploader falls.

A similar event at the CLB terminal would not cause any business interruption due to the presence of three car dumpers, with full CLB production able to meet with only two of these. 2.

The purpose of this approach is to ensure remediation takes place quickly in the highest priority areas, with piles grouped in accordance with age and preliminary condition assessment. Detailed scoping and significant project management is required to ensure quality work in a safe manner. With a large quantity of work involved, scoping and remediating in smaller groups is deemed to be the most time efficient approach, ensuring highest priorities are remediated quickly. enable CLO to quantify and priorities the defects. In 2024 the coating and defect remediation will begin as the priorities of the project align with the priorities of site. Whilst also enabling a spend of $30-40M annually from 2024 to 2030.

This Slope Management Plan (SMP) has been developed to satisfy the requirements of the Western Australia Mines Regulations and the Rio Tinto Surface Safety Standard D3, Management of Slope Geotechnical Hazards’ (“The Standard”). This document covers engineered slopes, including stockpiles and natural slopes in those areas defined as current and planned engineered slopes at the Ports. As stated above the Geotechnical Risks associated with man made and natural slopes on site are covered under the Rio Tinto D3 standard. Under this standard there are a variety of controls put in place to understand and manage these risks. These include: -A coastal Slope Management Plan with corresponding risk assessments, hazard maps and hazard alerts -A Major Hazards first party assurance process to ensure communication between the site technical resources and the site management is maintained and there is visibility of risks and action status. This is reviewed by Technical Services and the RTIO SLT on a quarterly basis. Given the nature of the Port Operations, annual changes to geotechnical risk profile are limited. The sites are inspected by the Qualified Individual on a quarterly basis, although there is no formal monitoring process given the relatively low risk profile of slopes at the port. The road cuttings to the base of Car Dumper 5, and Car Dumber 6&7 are being monitored for movement and condition changes on the engineering controls (mech and anchors) with an inhouse colour lidar scan on a 13- week frequency and an annual program of maintenance has been initiated to repair slope mesh and anchors on these cuttings. The first round of slope protection maintenance is complete with CD5 rock scaling. An ongoing program for progressive remediation is occurring.

The Series Five DUKC software system has been implemented. This system provides real time UKC data including incorporation in real time of live metocean data of swell and wind and improved weather forecast data. The UKC data is provided to shore personnel and also the pilots on board vessels. This data helps assist in making optimum decisions in the event of a vessel failure.  It is now standard procedure to provide tethered escort for all loaded ships departing the port. In 95% of cases there are two tugs escorting the departing ships to channel marker 3 and one tug remaining tethered until Fairway marker. This escort towage provides a significant risk reduction for the risk of channel blockage. Fairway marker marks the end of the continuously dredged channel through shallow water, beyond which grounding in a manner which has a significant business interruption effect is much less likely.  The channel is surveyed annually. A budget is established for channel dredging annually, however actual dredging requirements are determined based on the survey outcomes.  The channel is inspected after severe cyclones to check it is clear of fouling. This check is by helicopter and pilot boat using echo sounder. Note: The PPA are likely to determine mandatory further channel surveys based on the severity of any cyclone that has caused closure of the port.  All bulk carriers loading at the port are subjected to a rigorous approval procedure including the “Rightship” database, which is continuously updated by RTIO and other Pilbara bulk loading ports.  Maintenance of the tugs is according to Lloyds standards. Lloyds carry out an annual survey of the tugs to ensure they meet the required standards.  An ongoing towline management system is in place.

The sunken ship prevents passage of fully loaded bulk carriers. The possibility (in a worst case) is that the incident causes release of hydrocarbons from the affected ship. As a result the port operations are closed by the port authority for a period of two weeks whilst investigations, clean-up of the affected areas and port operations procedures around the sunken vessel are devised and approved by the port authority." ;

           ns1:workaround "Immediately following the incident, Cape Lambert is able to increase shipping by 21.0 Mtpa (from 190.0 Mtpa to its full capacity of 211 Mtpa) due to reduction in railing to Dampier. Arrangements are made to partially load vessels such that they can maintain the required under keel clearance while steaming outside the channel. Reduced port throughput occurs because of extra ship movements, reduced tidal \"window\" for sailing and precautions necessary to navigate past the sunken vessel. Extra tug fees to assist with navigation difficulties would be charged to the ship charterer. Other possible workarounds include requesting smaller class vessels for loading, which are less tidally constrained. The use of smaller vessels reduces the efficiency of the shiploading operations due to increased time periods for vessel changeover and hatch changes. Capacity at Dampier is reduced by based upon the degree to which ships would be lightly loaded to allow avoidance of the sunken vessel in the channel and the other constraints described above. This estimate is based on a nominal 3 metre lower draft than normal. During the port closure period the shipping at increases its total shipping from its forecast 190.0 Mtpa to its nominal capacity of 211.0 Mtpa reducing the net lost shipping rate by 21.0 Mtpa. The production loss is 150.0 - 21.0 (increase at Cape Lambert) Mtpa = 129.0Mtpa. This is 129.0 Mtpa / 150.0 Mtpa = 86.0% production loss at Dampier. After 2 weeks the port is reopened and Dampier shipping restarts but with an average reduction in draft of 3 metres for all ships leaving the port. This creates a shortfall of shipped ore to meet the production forecast and additional ships are chartered to ship this ore. A total of 36 more ships require to be chartered over the ten weeks each sailing with a reduced iron ore capacity of 144,000 tonnes. The cost of the extra charters is 36 extra ships x USD17,000 per day x 38 days round trip = USD23.26M. See section 2.2 for the assumptions that underlie the above calculations. This loss has been included as an Additional Cost: USD23.26M." ;

Inherent Controls  Computer based ship simulation work indicates that hard grounding causing point loading is unlikely due to the shape of the channel.  Departing vessels always have a clearance distance from one another as the same tugs are used during each deberthing so there is at least 40 minutes separating departures.  The channel is not shared with other major port users such as Woodside. incidents between inbound and outbound vessels).  Surveys have identified two suitable safe temporary anchoring locations adjacent to the channel and normal departure path.

Hard Controls  No \"Hard Controls\" applicable to this hazard. reached) and can call for tugs assistance if they think the conditions warrant it.  Dampier operates a Dynamic Under Keel Clearance (DUKC) system that receives data on wave and tidal conditions to combine with individual vessel hull information so allowable loading draft can be forecast for all vessels while loading. The Series Five DUKC software system has been implemented. This system provides real time UKC data including incorporation in real time of live metocean data of swell and wind and improved weather forecast data. The UKC data is provided to shore personnel and also the pilots on board vessels. This data helps assist in making optimum decisions in the event of a vessel failure.  It is now standard procedure to provide tethered escort for all loaded ships departing the port. In 95% of cases there are two tugs escorting the departing ships to channel marker 3 and one tug remaining tethered until Fairway marker. This escort towage provides a significant risk reduction for the risk of channel blockage. Fairway marker marks the end of the continuously dredged channel through shallow water, beyond which grounding in a manner which has a significant business interruption effect is much less likely.  The channel is surveyed annually. A budget is established for channel dredging annually, however actual dredging requirements are determined based on the survey outcomes.  The channel is inspected after severe cyclones to check it is clear of fouling. This check is by helicopter and pilot boat using echo sounder. Note: The PPA are likely to determine mandatory further channel surveys based on the severity of any cyclone that has caused closure of the port.  All bulk carriers loading at the port are subjected to a rigorous approval procedure including the “Rightship” database, which is continuously updated by RTIO and other Pilbara bulk loading ports.  Maintenance of the tugs is according to Lloyds standards. Lloyds carry out an annual survey of the tugs to ensure they meet the required standards.  An ongoing towline management system is in place. Individual towline data (based on feedback from tug crews) is maintained. Tow lines are retired based on the number of towing jobs they conduct (this is nominally after 2,000 jobs). Sections of some towlines  Training and competence of the pilots is managed by the Pilbara Port Authority (PPA).

In addition, each ship movement (arrival and departure) is documented and communicated to the ship's master and helmsman in a Pilots Passage Plan. This is a specific document for each ship movement. The pilots use this to communicate the plan for the passage to the master and helmsman.  AMSA surveyors regularly inspect vessels arriving at Dampier and have authority to detain vessels until safety systems are in good operating order.  RTIO (and the pilots) vet the vessel loading plan to ensure integrity limits of the vessel are not exceeded.  RTIO and the PPA independently audit the procedures followed by the pilots and vessel masters.  The pilot has the discretion to call for additional tugs during berthing/deberthing if they think the conditions warrant it.  Pilots have undertaken simulation training on how to control a disabled vessel in the channel using a single tethered tug.  Portable Pilot Units are deployed, so that each pilot has on board handheld tablet style device that combines GPS data and mapping software to provide a real-time position and course track showing channel location, sea bed survey data and channel markers.  RTIO and the pilotage contractor extract data on vessel passages and other measures to evaluate pilot performance. scenario is practised during pilot simulation training.  Portable Pilot Units (PPU) are deployed, so that each pilot has on board handheld tablet style device that combines GPS data and mapping software to provide a real-time position and course track showing channel location, sea bed survey data and channel factors including transit speed.  RTM DOOS program was developed in collaboration with key partners to strengthen ties in safety & crew welfare which inherently impacts vessel maintenance.  TVQ (Terminal Vetting Questionnaire) is used to review the ships suitability to our berths, helicopter access suitability, hatch dimensions, crewing numbers and experience.

Maintain the fire pumps, in accordance with Australian Standards AS1851 – 2005 (including annual flow testing). Where the town water supply can meet the fire service pressure and flows, a single diesel fire pump is acceptable. In the short term, the following items should be considered; Provide specific training and instructions to the ERT team on the manual starting of the existing diesel fire pumps. The valve on the discharge line of the fire pump at EII is normally closed and should be manually opened when starting the pump. The high pressure loss from the EII fire pump should be investigated. Valves on the water lines servicing the fire systems and hydrants should be physically checked to ensure that valves are open and in a serviceable condition. While these diesel pumps form an element of the site’s water services, they should be treated and maintained as fire equipment. The fire pumps at Parker Point and East Intercourse Island should include alarms and supervisory signals from all pumps, and should include; - Pump running alarm - Power isolated warning signal - Pump fail to start alarm - Battery and charge failure warning signal - High Temperature and low oil warning signals These signals shall report back to the ERT control room." ;

Cape Lambert increases its total shipping from its forecast 190.0 Mtpa to its nominal capacity of 211.0 Mtpa reducing the net lost shipping rate by 21.0Mtpa. The production loss is 103.8 – 3.0 (increase at EII) – 21.0 (increase at Cape Lambert) Mtpa = 79.8Mtpa. This is 79.8 Mtpa / 150.0 Mtpa = 53.2% production loss at Dampier.

For guidance, the following is suggested: 1. Functionally test each fire detection system, document cause and effect upon registration of a fire alarm, inclusive of CITECT actions; 2. Establish required works to ensure alignment with the requirements of AS1670.1, AS14520 and AS3007; 3. Ensure Fire System and RTIO superintendent / responsible site persons and/or their CITECT contractors meet and review existing functionality so as to develop scope of work to enable improved alignment of operation; 4. Following agreement and implementation of outcomes, retest and verify systems operations to ensure consistency with agreed cause and effect matrices; 5. It is noted that functional operation should also be deployed to those electrical switchrooms where no gaseous fire suppression is installed; 6.

Implementation of online condition monitoring of the insulation resistance to determine the health of the installation from the transformers to the substation and the connected load. There’re two types of insulation faults: Phase-to-phase insulation fault Phase-to-earth? insulation fault systems?like Dampier’s) are achieved by residual current monitoring of outgoing?feeders or current monitoring on Transformer’s Neutral – to – Earth connection. Regular insulation resistance test only give you snapshots of insulation of the installation is still healthy. The only way to guarantee that is to continuously monitor loads and earth leakage currents. ?In most cases, insulation deteriorates slowly over the time. So, by monitoring the currents, the insulation deterioration can be detected and recognised at an early stage well before it reaches critical point making protective devices trip. The main benefit of the continuously monitoring is that you know everything about health of the installation at any given time that can help to avoid unexpected interruptions to the process, unplanned downtime and costly repair.

                 ns1:siteResponseOrComments "DPO 2022: The observed severe pile corrosion on the EII tugpen is within the 406mm diameter raked piles in Berth 2. These racking piles primary function is to transfer load from the tug spring lines when moored in normal operating conditions. The piles also provide lateral restraint of the structure under extreme (cyclonic) conditions when both the floating pontoons and tug boats are removed and on their cyclone moorings. The piles do not directly support the jetty walkway. Complete catastrophic failure of a raking pile may result in localised damage to a wharf finger under cyclonic or vessel load, however such a failure is very unlikely to damage a tug boat when at berth (not during cyclone) or result in a loss of production due to reduced tug boat availability. We have 5 tug boats and 6 tug boat berths, hence a single tug boat would need to be anchored and access by small craft if a finger is not available. Operationally, only 4 tug boats are required for port operations. Consequently, the probable loss resulting from a failure is considered to be less than $25M. Remediation of the existing defects which was identified during structural integrity inspections is scheduled for early 2023.Unfortunately we have historically had some delays due to concerns with how to safety remove paint containing asbestos. However the paint removal methodology has now been approved, hence works can proceed. Hawcroft 2023: The worst affected piles were refurbished and are now fit for purpose. This recommendation is considered completed." ;

Immediately, the following changes are made to offset the loss: EII increases production from its forecast 46.2 Mtpa rate to its nominal capacity of 49.2 Mtpa reducing the net lost shipping rate by 3.0 Mtpa. Cape Lambert increases its total shipping from its forecast 190.0 Mtpa to its nominal capacity of 211.0 Mtpa reducing the net lost shipping rate by 21.0Mtpa. The production loss is 103.8 – 3.0 (increase at EII) – 21.0 (increase at Cape Lambert) Mtpa = 79.8Mtpa. This is 79.8 Mtpa / 150.0 Mtpa = 53.2% production loss at Dampier. Fuel supplies during the outage come from King Bay & Port Hedland directly to the mine sites. To cart fuel to Cape Lambert it is estimated to cost USD400k extra per month. To cart fuel inland to the mine sites directly on road trains it is estimated to cost an extra USD4.2M per month. Hence total cost of extra cartage is (0.4M + 4.2M) x 16 = USD73.6M." ;

Isolation valves have been provided across the site to permit sectional control. The water supply systems for Parker Point (PPt) and East Intercourse Island (EII) are provided as follows: - The Parker Point (PPt) water supply system is reticulated for plant and fire protection use and includes associated general works area. The supplies are looped at the stockyard and port facilities. The water supply for fire protection services at PPt is provided from a common site main (process / fire water). This system is supplied via three domestic electric pumps and is supported by an automatic start dedicated diesel fire pump. The pumps draw from a ground level steel tank (1,000cu.m capacity - 300cu.m reserved for fire water), which is infilled from the aforementioned 912cu.m gravity tanks. - The water supply to East Intercourse Island (EII) is drawn from a metered connection to the WAWA supply (i.e. the connection taps into the overland line supplying the two 912cu.m WAWA tanks). The EII water supply provides both process and fire water. The network is configured such that only a small portion of the stockyard is looped. The system is boosted in part by a single combined process / fire diesel pump located at both the Car Dumper and at the Causeway. The EII Car Dumper has an automatic start combined process / fire diesel fire pump, which takes suction from a 455cu.m tank. At the Causeway there are three domestic electric pumps, which are supported by an automatic start combined process / fire diesel pump, which takes suction from a 9,613cu.m tank (2,043cu.m reserved for fire water).

Expected completion June 2018. 2018: The Oyu Tolgoi Expansion Project includes the installation of two additional presses sited about 30 ft. from the existing presses. Plans have been developed for the installation of foam water suppression and a UV/IR detection system. The project team is also investigating the use of less hazardous hydraulic fluids and fire activated interlocks. 2019: Plans are developed for fire suppression systems over the two existing filter presses and the two new filter presses. Installation of the sprinkler protection system is planned following completion of the installation of the new filter presses. 2020: Feasibility study is in progress and detailed engineering to be completed in Q4 2020. Once Mongolian Authority approved the detailed engineering, project will commence after the Investment Committee approval. It is included in the 2021 capital plan. 2021: Larox filter presses fire protection – Feasibility is complete. Budget approval is in process. Project starts on 8th of April 2021. Ends on September 20th of 2021. OTC has provided documentation and installed a combination of aerosol (Stat-X) and dry chemical suppression in these units. Detection is a combination of heat ENG-G-08-07 Hydraulic Systems and the recommendation as written. Specifically the use of water based systems in combination with immediate shutdown interlocks is recommended. Details of the protection and detection will need to be further reviewed at 2022 visit. 2022 HCI: Site has installed condensed aerosol automatic suppression comprising \"Tungus\" and \"Statex\" branded equipment to each press and within each supporting hydraulic power pack. As-built only documentation has been sighted confirming installation and arrangement of operation. It is noted that whilst copper concentrate may not be combustible, review of associated product Material Safety Data Sheets advise that the product may react to high temperatures and become unstable, particularly where large quantities of product may be present. In these situations powder based suppression systems may not be appropriate. Additionally, the magnitude of the incident may be magnified by the presence of filter press polyethylene coverings and polypropylene filter plates and membranes. Consequently, site is to review and reconsider the use of condensed powder based systems and retrofit water based deluge fire suppression. OTC 2021: The aerosol pressed suppression systems “Tungus” and “Stat-x” are installed in Larox filter. Fire hose cabinet is on the west side of the Larox filter and fire hydrant is located outside of the building.

So, site would like to know that installing a small automatic aerosol fire extinguishing module on a 0.4kV distribution board is can implement the recommendations of critical risk scenario # OTC-10 by MAFSET in January 2021. 2nd pre-feasibility is in progress. Site is considering detection only. 2022 HCI: Discussion with site together with review of site risks has confirmed that switchyard equipment may be manually changed in the event of a compromised relay room, consequently, the scope of the recommendation has been reviewed, and adjusted to require the installation of aspirating smoke detection including in cabinet sampling of all racks within the 220Kv Relay Room. HCIG 2023: This recommendation has been superseded by a new recommendation related to a risk assessment of all critical electrical rooms where fire suppression system is not provided." ;

The stability models used 3D numerical groundwater flow conditions (heads and pore pressures) developed by Piteau Associates. The analysis undertaken by Piteau quantify groundwater distribution and flow dynamics at quarterly time increments for each phase. This combined mechanical and hydrogeological analysis has provided improved design guidelines. At the time of the 2023 CRA survey design work for Phase 7 was almost complete. Rio Tinto has a design acceptance criteria which includes a minimum factor of safety (FoS) of 1.3. Due to the pit development these studies are almost continuous." ,

(updated in 2021). Whilst four breach locations were assessed for modelling purposes, the credibility of the event occurring was also considered. A breach towards the northern end of the facility is credible due to water ponding and foundation conditions within the area. Dam break studies used the following scenarios: - North east breach - seismic and piping induced failure. - South east breach - no credible failure mode. - North west breach - seismic induced failure. - South west breach - no credible failure. For north east breach, the impacted area is increased significantly with tailings entering additional drainage channels beyond 30 km of the site. In 24 hours, 14 herder winter shelters and 15 herder wells are expected to be inundated. For south east breach, the impacted area is increased significantly with tailings entering additional drainage channels beyond 30 km of the site. In 24 hours, 14 herder winter shelters and 15 herder wells are expected to be inundated. For north west breach, both open pits are expected to be inundated. The booster pump station, the waste water pond and other site infrastructure to the east of the embankment are expected to be impacted. The tailings are expected to reach the underground access area to the north east of the embankment in the worst-case scenario. Whilst the model domain is located along the approximate mine lease boundary to the east, the depth of tailings flow suggests that the Gashuun Sukhait road would be impacted. This scenario has been used for the CRS - OTC 18. For south west breach, both mine open pits, booster pump station and associated infrastructure are expected to be inundated. The released tailings volumes from the credible failure of north east and north west locations for SDF scenario are estimated to be 19.6 Mm3 and 19.5 Mm3, respectively." ,

                                   ns1:assumptionDescription "The Business Interruption values for the Oyu Tolgoi Copper Mine are determined from information supplied by the Business Unit as at 1 March 2023. The estimated declared values are USD1,348.1M per annum. Any subsequent changes in commodity prices have not been considered in determining the loss estimates and the actual production/shipment may vary from planned/forecast volumes due to market condition. The weekly value of Business Interruption is calculated to be USD25.93M. The mine production plan for 2023 is 39.137 Mt of ore from the open pit and stockpiles to the process plant. The underground mine will produce 2.705 Mt of ore resulting in total processed tonnes of 39.600 Mt. Underground production is forecast at 6% of the total. Total material movements in the open pit are 112.190 Mt with 14,213 Mt from High, Medium and Low Grade stockpiles. The mine production plan for 2024 forecasts an increase in underground mine production to 7,050 Mt from a total production of 42,522 Mt or 16% of production from underground. This forms the basis of the business interruption calculations in the loss scenarios. Plant throughput for 2024 is forecast at 42.522 Mt and yielding 869 kt of copper concentrate (242 kt of copper), 247 kozs of gold and 1,527 kozs of silver. The inclusion of underground mining provides two discrete ore sources for Oyu Tolgoi. For the CRS business interruption calculations it was assumed that the underground mining activity supplies 16% of ore requirements over the next 12 months. For the next 12 months underground production is constrained by hoisting capacity until the decline belt is commissioned in Q4, 2024. Production activity is also constrained by ventilation capacity while ventilation shafts are completed. At the end of 2023 stockpile volumes are forecasted to be 44.985 Mt of low grade (LG) strategic ore, 13.193 Mt of medium grade ore and 2.346 Mt of high grade ore. Critical Risk Scenarios and their associated loss expectancies do not consider the offset of existing stockpiles, which are extensive. Stockpile movements and rehandling are included in the production planning and as a source of ore, so may be included in the workarounds of some loss scenarios. The stockpiles, generally, are also identified as a hard control for mining loss scenarios. Workarounds requiring the contracting out of the handling of ore or waste, where the site already has operating costs. Marginal cost of workarounds requiring the contract double handling of stockpile ore is USD1.00/tonne. Cost to hire a large excavator is USD250,000 per month. Cost to hire a large truck is USD150,000 per month. The underground fleet has significant spare capacity and underground production will not over the next 12 months be a significant contributor to the production volumes. there is a large project UG mining fleet which will transfer across as the mine footprint extends. Individual equipment asset values are typically <USD2.5M. The cost of replacement equipment includes 10% inflation factor from the previous 2022 survey in line with international expectations and are as follows: RH 495B hydraulic shovel, USD16.5M. Caterpillar 6020 excavator, or equivalent = USD8.8M. Komatsu WA1200 wheel loader = USD5.5M. Komatsu 930E truck = USD7.3M. Cat 16M Grader = USD1.7M. Cat D11T dozer = USD3.0M. Cat 777 water cart = USD2.8M. Cat 994 wheel loader = USD6.6M. Primary Crusher = USD13.0M. Overland Conveyor = USD16.2M. Coarse Ore Storage = USD24.0M. Concentrator Complex = 2,245.4M. SAG Mill Drive = USD19.3M. Pebble Crusher = USD25.0M. Ball Mill Circuit = USD61.4M. Cyclones = USD4.0M. Regrinding = USD6.7M. Flotation Circuit = USD32.12M. Concentrate Thickeners = USD2.8M. Tailings Thickener = USD11.7M. Concentrate Storage = USD6.5M. Bagging Plant = USD12.2M. 220 kV Substation = USD15.1M." .

Delivery is by truck, but rail transport is anticipated in the future. Coal consumption is 30,000 to 50,000 tonnes per annum and many weeks' supply is held on site. This has increased as a result of the increased heat demand from the underground construction project activity. No critical risk has been identified through loss of this supply." ;

The trailers go into customs storage for clearance before despatch. Convoys are escorted on their journey to the China/Mongolian border. Trucks are fitted with GPS, cab cameras and drivers have smart caps for fatigue monitoring. The road journey to the border is approximately 100 km and nearly all on paved roads. There is often congestion at the border crossing before the convoy can access the bonded warehouse located at the border for copper concentrate. The closest rail spur to OT is 130 km distant and the site has run trials with different transport routes for both dispatched and goods inbound." .

                      ns1:otherDependenciesDescription "Potable water is supplied from the Gunii Hooloi borefield, located approximately 70 km north of the site. The borefield consists of 28 production bores, 3 monitoring bores, and 2 standby bores. Water is pumped to the site via a 70 km pipeline to a primary pump station and five secondary pump stations, filling two large reservoirs, or 'lagoons'. From these lagoons, water is distributed to the various users at the open cut mine, Concentrator, camp, underground mine, etc. A main pipeline break would not interrupt operations due to the dual feed lines. A leak in one of the lines occurred in 2021, requiring drainage of a lagoon to repair and this was done without any interruption. There is seven days' supply maintained in the lagoons. Water recycling has achieved an 85.44% performance rating exceeding the water recycling target of 80%. Pending government approval, and a need for additional water supply, the borefields can be expanded. In accordance to resolution No. 416 of the Government of Mongolia dated November 23, 2022, amount of water usage fees for 1 m3 of water used in concentrators under the subsection 'copper concentrate and fluorite enrichment' increased from 959.04 MNT to 1678.32 MNT, which is 75 % increased. OT is paying the relevant fees starting from 2023 Jan 1st. No critical risk has been identified through loss of this dependency." .

COVID-19 restrictions were fully lifted from February 2023. The site has a warehouse in Ulaanbaatar for third party supplies and approximately 95% of the goods received into this warehouse are from the local market. International freight also passes through this warehouse. Maintenance supplies are sourced from their OEM, are mandated to be provided through a Mongolian supplier. Chemicals go through a Mongolian licensed supplier for import. Grinding media transport and logistics are arranged by the Mongolian freight forwarder in Mongolian territory and Chinese freight forwarder in Chinese Territory. Exceptions are certain proprietary collectors and specialty spare parts for process equipment. There are five contracts in place for reagent suppliers and all are supplied through China. One item is supplied direct from the USA. Supplies and stores are marshalled at a yard in China and transported to the site by road. Site storages are sufficient for 30-35 days. The company has arranged for Mongolian suppliers to hold stocks in Mongolia and so to reduce holdings in China wherever possible. OT LLC has diversified its supplier base through the selection of alternative suppliers that can provide a cost advantage without sacrificing quality. Additional Chinese suppliers are adopted where appropriate. Development of long lead time strategies and improved knowledge of higher usage items is assisting in reducing the risks of this dependency. No critical risk has been identified through loss of this dependency." ;

              ns1:utilityOrSupplyDescription "Water is supplied from the Gunii Hooloi borefield, located approximately 70 km north of the site. The borefield consists of 28 production bores, 3 monitoring bores, and 2 standby bores. Water is pumped to the site via a 70 km pipeline to a primary pump station and five secondary pump stations, filling two large reservoirs, or 'lagoons'. From these lagoons, water is distributed to the various users at the open cut mine, Concentrator, camp, underground mine, etc. A main pipeline break would not interrupt operations due to the dual feed lines. A leak in one of the lines occurred in 2021, requiring drainage of a lagoon to repair and this was done without any interruption. There is seven days' supply maintained in the lagoons. Water recycling has achieved an 85.44% performance rating exceeding the water recycling target of 80%. Pending government approval, and a need for additional water supply, the borefields can be expanded. In accordance to resolution No. 416 of the Government of Mongolia dated November 23, 2022, amount of water usage fees for 1 m3 of water used in concentrators under the subsection 'copper concentrate and fluorite enrichment' increased from 959.04 MNT to 1678.32 MNT, which is 75 % increased. OT is paying the relevant fees starting from 2023 Jan 1st. No critical risk has been identified through loss of this dependency." ;

Based on port forecast tonnage of 150.0 Mt, this is an approximately 833 ships over the year. Reduced vessel load at 3 metre higher draft is 144 kT. Average loss of ore loaded to a single vessel is 36 kT. During the 10 week period of lightly loaded ships departing the port, there were a planned 833 x 10/52 = 160 ships departing. The net tonnes of iron ore not loaded by these ships is 160 x 36 kT = 5,760 kT. Additional ships required to transport this ore is 5,760/160 = 36 ships. Additional shipping requirements are able to be chartered. Towage capacity is able to support the additional movements. Typical Charter rate USD17,000 per day. Typical charter duration 38 days. Delay per ship changeover is 20 minutes. EII changeovers are longer due to one sided wharf loading at approximately 150 mins. On average this would give an average changeover time of approximately 60 minutes. Ship changeover additional production interruption is 36 ships x 60 minutes = 2,160 minutes. Over 10 weeks this 2,160 minutes of additional lost production is 2,160/10x7x24x60 = 2.1%. Ship changeover loss 2.1% (this small loss has been ignored in the loss estimate calculation for simplicity)." .
