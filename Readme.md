## Critical Risk Digitization

Critical Risk Digitization is an AI-driven project designed to extract and analyze information from PDF documents concerning critical risk scenarios in mine sites. The system processes these documents to build knowledge graphs and employs advanced retrieval techniques to facilitate efficient information access.

#### Data extraction

The “Data extraction” folder contains scripts for extracting information from text documents and constructing knowledge graphs based on a given ontology.

#### Retrieval

The “Retrieval” folder contains the scripts that define the RAG strategy based on the knwoledge graphs extracted from the documents.

#### UI

The “UI” folder contains the scripts that define the application interface. The framework used for the UI is Streamlit.
